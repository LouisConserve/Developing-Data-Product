# Developing-Data-Product

The shiny app allows any user to display car(s) based on some selections entered
and calculate the total gallon of gas that would be spend based on the total miles enter for a year.

We display the results in an interactive table as we though a table will be best suited in that case to allow the users to see all the different aspects of their selections.
